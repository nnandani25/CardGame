# CardGame
Instructions:
1. Each player gets 5 cards, when it is a players turn, they ask their opponent for a card that the current player has in their deck, in order to make a pair.
2. If the other player has that type of card, they have to give you all of those types of cards, and the player that recieved the card get 1 point.
3. If the other player does not have that type of card, then the current player 'goes fishing' gets another card from the deck.
4. The point is the get the most number of pairs until you have no cards left.
